                It has been long time I am not update my blog. Just because it was very busy and happened a lot of things last month.<br />
                As you know, the recruitment season about IT industry is begin in the September. So I was wanting a job throughout September.
                Perhaps it is because I am not lazy in studying, I got the Baidu offer smoothly. Moreover, I also got the Qunar and NetCase offer.
                Although the Qunar`s salary is very high and the NetCase is close to my home, but I chose Baidu finally.<br />
                Just Because the technology of Baidu is very niubility. I think I can learn and improve more in Baidu then in others.<br />
                And Yuan want me write down my experience of Baidu interview. He want to release in his blog.<br />
                <br />
                Ok~, And then, What I am doing lately? I am reading the sound code of JQuery and not completely understand it.
                But I find my code ability about JavaScript is improving.<br />
                <br />
                Do you know the Smartisan? the NutPhone is the Phone secondly version of Smartisan released.<br />
                And there has a funny and beatiful demo in the offical website of Smartisan. I code it down and put on my this blog.<br />
                You can Play the demo by <a href="NutPhoneDemo/index.html">CLICK HERE</a>!<br />
                Forget to say, the demo must open in the chrome or other high version browser. Beacuse I hadn`t do a lot things about compatibility.<br />
                <br />
                Things are too many that I want to talk, but I find just a fews words it was finished.<br/>
                All right, Maybe the feeling can be understand by the man who experience personaly.<br/>

                Right, the Double Seventh Day animation is finished, but how to talk about it?<br />
                Things about it is too many and I don`t know where to start.<br />
                Generally, this little animation is cool. It is suitable for the beginner of html5 and css3.
                You can learn many things about css3 animation from it, and I also writed a summary in my CSDN blog.
                If you want to read, please <a href="http://blog.csdn.net/u013578282/article/details/48131881" title="see the summary!">CLICK HERE</a>.<br />
                But actually, I am disagree something about the animation, or the teacher who teach this animation.<br />
                For example, the teacher declare a lot of redundant variables and functions but no use them, or just use them one time.<br />
                And I found many variables and functions declare just because we must to use it at that time, but do not make a good management about them later.<br />
                For the learner, I also doubt that why we don`t use the function declare just a moment ago instead of this new function ? The function of both function we declare are same.<br />
                Apart from this, something of service logic about the animation I am also disagree. Maybe the questions I doubt is a good way to achieve the programme, but now I follow my heart.<br />
                In the end, let`s enjoy the little animation of Double Seventh Day!<br />

                OK! Finally, I finish the animation of the Double Seventh Day lead by imooc.com.<br />
                There have many things about it to talk, but now is too late. I must to back dormitory.
                So I will write a summary and publish it tomorrow.<br />
                Good night!<br />

                When I try to import canvas to Catch Star, I found I am not proficient in it.<br/>
                So I go to imooc.com to learn how to use canvas. Canvas is easy, but you must to proficient in it if you
                want to make some cool and perfect animation.<br/>
                The below is a calculagraph make by canvas, is it cool? You can also learn how to make it in <a

                It took me three days to finish this game. We can call it Catch Star for a while being.<br/>
                I coded Small Battle City and Gluttonous Snake and other, but Catch Star is the first game that I have
                motivation to finish it.<br/>
                Just because the game can be play by the girl I like. It is wonderful!<br/>
                I hadn`t import canvas of html5, but I think it will make it more easy to code, so I will import this
                new funny technique.<br/>
                You can see Catch Star below:<br/>
